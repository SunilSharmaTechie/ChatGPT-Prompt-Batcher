## Problem Context

Manual prompt entry and copying results from ChatGPT or LLM interfaces is inefficient for those who create modular content, generate batch-based AI documents, or manage AI-driven writing pipelines. Repeating this manually for every piece of structured work leads to inefficiency, breaks flow, and limits scalability.

**Why this matters:**

- Power users (engineers, educators, documentation teams) often use prompts as a system - not as one-off queries.
- Lack of automation prevents scaling these systems into reusable assets.
- Consolidation and export friction (e.g., for Markdown, PDF) adds more repetitive work.

**This tool solves these bottlenecks by enabling:**

- Sequential prompt execution (from JSON, text, Word, or PDF sources)
- Clean formatting and export in `.md`, `.pdf`, or `.txt`
- Integration with both OpenAI and open-source LLMs (like LLaMA, Ollama, HuggingFace models)
- Streamlit GUI for non-technical users or internal team workflows

# Project Features & Requirements

The ChatGPT Prompt Batcher has been thoughtfully designed to address the needs of engineers, prompt creators, and workflow automators who manage prompt sequences across tools like ChatGPT, local LLMs, or third-party hosted models. Below is a detailed breakdown of core and advanced features this utility provides.



## Core Features

- **Batch Prompt Execution**: Accept structured input from `.json`, `.txt`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, Google Drive URLs, or public file URLs.
- **Flexible Output Formats**: Export final outputs in `.md`, `.txt`, or `.pdf` - properly sectioned and formatted.
- **Model Flexibility**: Seamlessly switch between OpenAI APIs and open-source LLMs (via `llama.cpp`, LM Studio, or Hugging Face APIs).
- **CLI & GUI Support**:
  - CLI: For advanced users who want automation or scripting (`main.py` with flags)
  - GUI: Powered by Streamlit, for easier adoption by internal users, educators, or editors



## Advanced Capabilities

- **Parallel Batch Mode** *(Planned)*: Run non-blocking prompts when supported by the LLM
- **Retry Logic**: Gracefully recover from failed prompts, especially under API rate limits
- **Response Memory Chain** *(Future scope)*: Feed one promptâ€™s result into the next
- **Language Detection**: Auto-detect content language and optionally apply tone/styling
- **Analytics**: Log token usage, errors, timing, and file size summaries for optimization

# Architecture Overview and Flow

To ensure flexibility, speed, and modularity, the ChatGPT Prompt Batcher has been designed with a loosely coupled architecture that supports CLI and GUI workflows, integrates with multiple LLM providers, and allows various input and output formats.



## System Components

1. **Prompt Input Handler**

   - Accepts prompts from multiple sources: JSON, TXT, DOCX, PDF, Streamlit input, or URL-based files.
   - Uses content extractors to unify data into a clean internal format with prompt titles and bodies.

2. **Prompt Execution Engine**

   - Runs prompts one-by-one through the selected LLM backend (OpenAI or OSS).
   - Handles retries, API delay configurations, and logging.
   - Supports memory chaining (coming soon).

3. **LLM Backend Layer**

   - Supports both proprietary and open-source models:
     - OpenAI (via `openai.ChatCompletion.create()`)
     - Local models using `llama-cpp-python`, LM Studio API, or Hugging Face REST API.
   - Switches via CLI flag or GUI dropdown.

4. **Output Generator**

   - Collects all responses and saves them as one file.
   - Output options include Markdown (`.md`), PDF (`.pdf`), or Plain Text (`.txt`).
   - Includes section headings, formatting, and original prompt context.

5. **Interface Layer**

   - **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Accepts flags, config files, and logging.
   - **Streamlit GUI**: Supports drag-and-drop file upload, manual prompt entry, and live progress visualization.

# CLI Usage and Configuration Flags

The tool is designed for both automation-focused developers and interactive users. This section outlines how to operate the system using the command-line interface (CLI), detailing each argument, flag, and its behavior.



## Basic Command

To run the tool from the command line:

```bash
python run.py --input prompts/sample_prompts.json --format md --use openai
```



## CLI Arguments and Flags

| Argument            | Type     | Description                                                                 |
||-|--|
| `--input`           | string   | Path to a local `.json`, `.txt`, `.docx`, or `.pdf` file OR a public URL    |
| `--format`          | string   | Output file format: `md`, `pdf`, or `txt`                                   |
| `--use`             | string   | LLM backend: `openai` or `oss`                                              |
| `--delay`           | integer  | Delay in milliseconds between prompts (default: 1000)                       |
| `--output`          | string   | Output filename (optional, defaults to `output_<timestamp>`)               |
| `--title`           | string   | Title of the session (included in output headers)                           |
| `--log-level`       | string   | Logging level: `info`, `debug`, `warning`, `error`                          |
| `--stream`          | boolean  | If true, stream output as prompts run (when backend supports it)           |
| `--max-tokens`      | integer  | Set maximum tokens per response (default varies by backend)                |
| `--temperature`     | float    | Controls randomness of output (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = more creative)    |



## Environment Configuration (.env)

All sensitive and backend-specific configuration should go in the `.env` file. This includes both proprietary (OpenAI) and open-source (OSS) models.

### Example for OpenAI:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
DEFAULT_BACKEND=openai
DEFAULT_OUTPUT_FORMAT=pdf
DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
```

### Example for OSS (LLaMA, Ollama, Hugging Face APIs):
```
DEFAULT_BACKEND=oss
OSS_MODEL_PATH=./models/llama-model.gguf
OSS_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:11434/api
OSS_MODEL_NAME=llama-2
```

The tool auto-detects the backend specified in the CLI flag or `.env` and loads the appropriate handler.

Use `python-dotenv` to load these automatically during runtime via `config.py`.



## Example Use Cases

- **Run a full prompt session using OpenAI and export as Markdown:**
  ```bash
  python run.py --input prompts/blog_ideas.json --format md --use openai
  ```

- **Run a `.docx` file using a local model backend with 3-second delay:**
  ```bash
  python run.py --input prompts/curriculum.docx --use oss --delay 3000
  ```

- **Stream each prompt and output a combined PDF report:**
  ```bash
  python run.py --input prompts.json --stream true --format pdf
  ```

This CLI system is designed for professionals who need automation and control while allowing flexibility to fine-tune prompt execution workflows.

# Streamlit GUI Capabilities

For users who prefer a visual interface or are less familiar with the command line, the tool includes a Streamlit-based GUI. It offers intuitive features for loading prompts, configuring execution, and downloading output - all within a browser window.

- **Non-engineers** testing prompts without CLI setup
- **Internal demos** and AI writing tools for teammates



## Design Philosophy

The GUI has been designed to:
- Reduce friction for less technical users
- Support consistent workflows across multiple use cases
- Allow rapid testing of prompt sequences without code

It offers the same backend capabilities as the CLI while focusing on simplicity, usability, and guided prompt batch building.


# Output Formats and Document Styling

This tool supports exporting the batch output into multiple formats with clean styling for readability, sharing, and documentation purposes. Each export method is tailored for different end-user goals-whether technical publishing, client reporting, or internal documentation.



## Supported Output Formats

Additional formats such as `.docx` may be added in future updates based on user needs and collaboration feedback.

| Format   | Description                                                                 |
|-|--|
| Markdown (`.md`) | Ideal for developers, GitHub repos, documentation sites                  |
| PDF (`.pdf`)      | Suitable for business sharing, academic reports, printable content       |
| Plain Text (`.txt`)| Clean and fast format for CLI or scripting pipelines                    |



## Output Structure

All exported files follow a consistent and modular structure:

```
# Session Title (Optional)

## Prompt 1 Title
Prompt: <Prompt text>
Response:
<LLM Output>

## Prompt 2 Title
Prompt: <Prompt text>
Response:
<LLM Output>
...
```

Each section is:
- Clearly separated by headings and white space
- Numbered and titled (if available)
- Paired with its original prompt for full traceability



## Markdown & PDF Styling Details

- Headings: Prompt titles mapped to H2 (`##`) and section-level structure
- Indentation: Preserved formatting inside responses
- Line Wrapping: Applied to enhance mobile readability
- PDF Generator: Uses `fpdf` or `markdown2pdf` to maintain typography and margin consistency
- Font: Clean sans-serif, easy to read across print and screen



## Customization Options

- Theming and brand colors
- Custom logo injection in PDF exports
- Selective output filtering (e.g., hide prompt, show only responses)
- Summary overview page at the start of long sessions

This formatting standard is designed to support engineers, educators, and business users in consuming LLM-generated content in a structured and professional format.


# Error Handling and Retry Strategy

Building reliable prompt pipelines means gracefully handling failures, rate limits, and unexpected behaviors during execution. This section outlines the error handling architecture and retry logic designed to ensure consistent output with minimal interruption.



## Fault Tolerance by Design

- Each prompt execution is wrapped in a try-except block to catch exceptions without stopping the entire run.
- Failures are logged with timestamp, prompt title, and error type for traceability.
- Partial progress is saved to memory and optionally output at the end of the session.



## Retry Strategy

The system automatically retries failed prompts based on configurable logic:

- **Retry Attempts**: Default is 2 retries per failed prompt (can be adjusted via `config.py`).
- **Backoff Timing**: Delay increases with each retry using exponential backoff (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s).
- **Failure Tolerance**: After all retries fail, the system logs the prompt as `skipped` and continues.



## Rate Limit Awareness

When using APIs like OpenAI, the system checks for:
- `RateLimitError`
- `Timeout`
- `ConnectionError`

On detection:
- Waits and retries after cooldown period
- Reduces request frequency automatically



## Graceful Degradation

- Errors are recorded and reported at the end of execution
- A separate section is added in the export with details of prompts that failed, along with reasons
- Users can review and manually retry those prompts if needed



## Example Log Output

```
[2025-03-31 10:12:41] INFO Prompt 3 executed successfully.
[2025-03-31 10:12:43] WARNING Prompt 4 failed - retrying (attempt 1)

# Extending the Tool for New Use Cases

This tool has been architected to support extension and adaptation for a wide variety of real-world needs beyond simple prompt batching. Engineers, educators, and automation teams can tailor it to integrate with their broader ecosystems or enhance functionality over time.



## Modular Architecture Benefits

- Each module is decoupled and designed for isolated testing and scaling.
- Core logic (prompt execution, file parsing, backend selection) can be swapped or extended with minimal refactoring.
- The CLI and GUI share the same execution core, which simplifies expansion.



## Extension Opportunities

Here are example areas where the tool can be extended:

### 1. Custom Backend Support
- Add new modules under `src/integrations/` for models like Claude, Gemini, or Anthropic APIs.
- Use the same interface as `openai_client.py` to plug in easily.

### 2. Prompt Validation & Preprocessing
- Add NLP rules, linting, or AI-based validation for user-generated prompts.
- Automatically flag dangerous, incomplete, or misaligned prompt structures.

### 3. Post-Processing Filters
- Apply summarization, tone-matching, or language translation on responses.
- Add extra modules to reformat answers for specific platforms (Slack, blog, email).

### 4. Multi-User Collaboration
- Implement session saving, team review logs, and multi-user access via authentication.
- Tie outputs to named sessions stored on a database.

### 5. Workflow Automation Hooks
- Connect outputs to APIs like Notion, Google Docs, or CMS systems.
- Auto-upload results to cloud storage or analytics pipelines.

### 6. Scheduler Support
- Automate batch prompt execution via CRON jobs or CI pipelines.
- Log performance metrics over time and schedule recurring tasks.



## Plugin Strategy

A lightweight plugin architecture is being implemented to allow third-party developers to build and share extensions. The plugin manifest will:

- Define new backends or export formats
- Register with the main runner without editing core files
- Allow toggling via config or CLI flag

This keeps the core system clean and gives advanced teams a framework to contribute powerfully.


# Security, API Keys, and Configuration Safety

Security is a foundational concern in any tool that interacts with external APIs or handles sensitive content. This section outlines the best practices embedded into this tool to ensure safety, reliability, and confidentiality.



## Environment Configuration

- API keys and tokens are stored securely using a `.env` file.
- The `.env.example` template is provided to help users define their variables clearly without hardcoding secrets.
- Environment variables are loaded through `python-dotenv` and accessed only via the `config.py` interface.



## Secrets Handling Guidelines

- **No Keys in Code**: API keys are never written directly in the codebase.
- **Git Ignore**: `.env` is included in `.gitignore` by default to prevent accidental commits.
- **Validation**: The tool validates presence of critical environment variables before execution.
- **Scoped Access**: API keys should be limited in scope (read-only if possible) and rotated periodically.



## Secure Execution Environment

- Ensure the tool is executed in a virtual environment or container (e.g., Docker) to avoid exposing host credentials.
- Logging avoids echoing sensitive input or API keys.
- Rate limits and retry logic avoid flooding third-party APIs which could trigger automated bans.



## Sample `.env.example` Template

```
# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4

# OSS Model Settings
OSS_MODEL_PATH=./models/llama-model.gguf
OSS_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:11434

# Default Settings
DEFAULT_BACKEND=openai
DEFAULT_OUTPUT_FORMAT=md
```

This setup is designed to offer maximum flexibility while maintaining strict adherence to security and deployment standards.


# Maintaining, Scaling, and Contributing

The long-term success of this tool depends on clear maintenance practices, scalable development patterns, and a supportive contributor experience. This section outlines the key principles that make the project resilient, up-to-date, and open to collaboration.



## Maintenance Guidelines

- Keep dependencies updated regularly and check for known vulnerabilities using tools like `pip-audit`.
- Review API rate limits and update retry strategies as models evolve.
- Periodically revisit `.env.example`, prompt format templates, and export styling to reflect user feedback.
- Archive or deprecate unsupported models or endpoints with proper version tagging.



## Scalability Tips

- **Backend Modularity**: Each LLM integration is placed in a separate file under `src/integrations/`, allowing horizontal expansion.
- **Prompt Size Control**: Enforce prompt length validation to avoid unexpected token limits or pricing errors.
- **Parallel Execution (Future Feature)**: Planned support for parallel batch processing when using OSS models.
- **Data Store (Optional)**: Use SQLite or MongoDB to log and store batch histories for reprocessing and audits.



## Contributing to the Project

We welcome contributions from engineers, educators, researchers, and developers. To get started:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`feature/my-feature`)
3. Run lint and test checks before submitting a PR
4. Clearly describe your changes in the pull request
5. Reference issues or feature requests if applicable



## Code Style & Standards

- Follow `PEP8` for Python
- Use `black` for formatting
- Write clear docstrings for all public methods
- Organize imports with `isort`
- Keep functions under 50 lines where possible



## Issue Reporting

If you find a bug, security vulnerability, or documentation issue:
- Open a GitHub issue with steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Include logs, screenshots, and environment info where possible
- Use proper labels to categorize (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `docs`)

This approach ensures that the project remains open, reliable, and responsive as more users and contributors adopt the workflow.
